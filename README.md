# Algorithm Design and Analysis Orienteering Problem
The Orienteering Problem is a type of optimization problem that involves finding the
shortest possible route between a set of locations (often referred to as ”control points”)
while visiting each location only once. The goal is to maximize the total score obtained
by visiting these locations, where each location has a different score associated with it.
The problem is often encountered in the field of operations research, and has many
real-world applications, such as in logistics, transportation planning, and even in recreational
activities like hiking and orienteering.

## Project outlines
In this project your goal is to solve Orienteering Problem (OP). In order to attempt
that you should suggest at least three algorithms based on your course topics that you
think they can lead you to the optimal solution.
A number of standard instances will be provided to you so that you can test your
methods on them.

## Instance format
The first line contains the following data:
"Tmax P", 
where:
"Tmax = available time budget per path" & 
"P = number of paths (=1)"
The remaining lines contain the data of each point. For each point, the line contains
the following data:
"x y s"
where:
"x = x coordinate", 
"y = y coordinate" & 
s = score
